WikiLeaks has been posting the private emails of Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta and other Democratic officials. The U.S. says the emails were hacked by, or on behalf of, Russian intelligence agencies. Wikileaks said Assange's internet access was cut off Sunday. In a statement, Ecuador said the decision was its own.

Inner city , " a term that came up a lot in this election , is " imprecise in describing todays urban reality . 
If you've ever heard me say the " inner city " doesn't exist , this is what I was talking about 
Donald is wrong again , though that should come as no surprise at this point . 
and @AlanaSemuels are what you need on Trump's bizarre " inner cities " trope . 
with the story of how Trump took a sociological term full dog-whistle 
Its just a wrong term to use descriptively . All it does is reach the ears of white voters in a particular way . 
The inner cities are in pretty good shape . 
A term Donald Trump used in Sundays debate has become a popular shorthand conflating cities, crime, poverty and minorities.

I propose a new rule we stop listening to Rudy Giuliani's nonsense political rhetoric . Like what he says here 
NY Times editorial Instead of disavowing this absurdity outright , Republican leaders sit by in spineless .

A fact generally isn't something completely made up . 
Retweeted margaret stuart md Trump Said Women Get Abortions Days Before Birth . Doctors Say They .

Whether Clinton or Trump wins the Communist Party believes ITS already a winner . on the view from China

The election certainly makes it harder for the US to argue that its democratic system is inherently superior . 
irony is that this election is turning China off western democracy 
in agreement with the first part of this , but the ' CPC is scared ' meme drives me up the wall

Humiliates Women Who reject Him ! Stop this Pig on Nov 8 ! 
While Comey was distracting us , more Trump accusers came forward . 
What #Trump has done 2 people isn't nice , ethical or rational but strange & amp ; rather evil . 
What a sick o contesting for president ! 
He told the audience he wanted revenge for some perceived slight. He got it.
Perceived control is very important It diminishes stress and promotes well being . 
Our world is filled with false items to enhance our sense of control but the truth is there is no control 
Fuck it then , I'll just let my grandson push all those buttons and stop yelling , " No , you'll break something " ! 
Pushing That Crosswalk Button May Make You Feel Better , but 
I knew it . In our hearts , we all knew it . Come out of the fog and live your lives with eyes wide open , people ! 
This article is messing me up . 
Thats right- Crosswalk and elevator buttons are purely for your sanity . 
Pushing That Crosswalk Button May Make You Feel Better, but
Some buttons, such as the door-close button on an elevator, are mere artifices  placebos that promote an illusion of control but in reality do not work.

Tell us your thoughts ! should the IRS be able to penalize people for not having health insurance ? 
If you make the penalties tougher , you need to make financial assistance broader and deeper . 
Young and healthy people choose the lesser cost . Have you thought about genetic disorders and accidents 
For millions , paying penalty for not having coverage is cheaper than the insurance itself 
Healthy Millennials will pay more to the Government and Still Have No Health Care ! 
Affordable Care Act tax penalty is toothless 
Has the tax penalty been large enough to motivate people to sign up for health insurance ? 
Exactly what CJ Roberts relied on to uphold Obamacare under taxing power that many would opt to pay the tax penalty 
A lot of healthy people are defying predictions by the Affordable Care Act architects and refusing to enroll, throwing off the math behind the system.

CMV Is a Greater Threat to Infants Than Zika , but Far Less Often Discussed 
I never heard of this virus . 
Laura Sweet had no idea that she had contracted a virus that would leave her daughter , Jane , deaf by her first . 
When are we going to wake up & amp ; invest in the known threats ? Health officials called for a CMV vaccine decades ago . 
Many women say they don't know much about CMV , the most common congenital viral infection , which can be fatal 
CMV Is a Greater Threat to Infants Than Zika, but Far Less Often Discussed

US election 2016 Indians ' verdict on Donald Trump's Hindi 
However , when a BBC reporter showed Trump's ad around Delhi , it was met with amusement , incredulity , & amp ; worry 
This is my to-cherish memento of Campaign 2016 . 
I thought the US was a developed country , but after seeing this man come this far , I am having serious doubts 
Trump spoke a few words of Hindi in a pitch to Indian Americans 
Good thing he's not running for office in India 
People praise Kaine's Spanish and insinuate Trump must know Russian . Now , Trump ties Hindi 
MSM will always have something negative to say . It is not about India , It is about USA 
US election 2016: Indians' verdict on Donald Trump's Hindi - BBC News

The New Weiner Emails Wont Hurt Clinton . Our Tribal Politics Has Killed the " October Surprise . 
In this election , and every election , tribal affiliations matter more than any October surprise 
voters are tribalistic . Their political allegiances come first , and their positions and beliefs follow . 
What a candidatebelievesis less important to voters than his or her partisan affiliation . 
polarization is so strong , in fact , that it renders the gaffes of recent elections almost irrelevant . 
Whatever they reveal , the new Weiner emails probably wont hurt Clinton . 
Time to move on from this nonsensical distraction . 
Media & amp ; GOP have beaten us in the head with #HillarysEmails SO MUCH , it's no longer an effective weapon .

In 2011 , Donald Trump humiliated a Miss Universe onstage .

He told the audience he wanted revenge for some perceived slight. He got it.

Donald Trump holds the advantage in the reliably Republican states of Arizona and Texas with five days until Election Day, but he's running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton in Georgia, according to a trio of new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls. In Arizona, Trump leads Clinton by five points among likely voters, 45 percent to 40 percent, while Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3 percent. In a head-to-head matchup in Arizona, Trump's edge remains five points. In Georgia, however, Trump is ahead by just one point among likely voters.

What happens when you ask white Berkeley liberals & amp ; black people in Harlem about anti-voter ID arguments

This is what we're saying that to assume that being a minority means you're too ill informed or ignorant to .

Absurd claim of Trump that Hillary's email problem is worse than Watergate is debunked . 
John Dean wrote this & amp ; Carl Bernstein tweeted . Sadly , Politico poll shows 45% say worse than Watergate . 
John Dean , who should know , on why this email business is so not Watergate , let alone worse , as The Oaf says 
@realDonaldTrump has Nixon's dangerous flaws but none of his strengths . 
The comparison shows just how little Clintons critics understand about the two scandals.

What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership ?

What would be lost with the #TPP gone .

Autocracy: Rules for Survival
However well-intentioned, talk presuming Trump'#039;s good faith assumes that he is prepared to find common ground with his many opponents, respect the institutions of government, and repudiate almost everything he has stood for during the campaign. In short, it is treating him as a normal politician. There has until now been little evidence that he can be one. It might be worth considering the rules I've learned for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and self-respect.

In the new media world , every story risks being discredited as " fake news , " not by argument but by sheer force .

Yeah , weve heard the " real reporting " and , sometimes , the " fake news " is more accurate . This is all . 
Fake news , " a term I have used , is probably a trap .

Hate crimes against Muslim-Americans went up up 67% from 2014 to 2015 , as per a new FBI report .

NES Classic Edition review ! Must have this console ! 
At $60 , the NES Classic Edition offers an incredible nostalgic value . Read our review 
Retro Gaming from @Nintendo . Kudos for taking us back decades . 
Here is a great review if any of you are thinking about picking up the new NES 
NES Classic Edition review great selection of games and excellent NES emulation , but no way to buy new games , and 
Leave it to @Nintendo to make an amazing retro product that's sold out . but make people sit 3 ft from the TV 
I'd totally slap down some Queens for this , but alas " CONTRA " is missing from the game roster . 
In a stream of despair , let's be positive & amp ; talk about cool things . like this new Classic NES ! 
Nintendo , you made the cord too short . Otherwise , great job . 
As expected , the NES Classic is a winner but the controller cable is a problem .

Why Did Facebook Say I Was Dead ? 
Apparently a glitch on Facebook told millions of users that they were support vector machines 
Did anyone here have Facebook announce they were dead ? 
Why Is Facebook Saying Im Dead ? by KATIE ROGERS v 
I MUST be dead . I read it on the internet . 
I don't understand how this even happens 
I was not among yesterday's Facebook dead .

No time to check Facebook yesterday to see if I was dead . 
On Friday afternoon, Facebook started telling users that their pages had been memorialized. Then things got awkward.
A lot of controversy over popular votes vs electoral college has a lot of people upset and confused . 
On #dec19 , heroic #RogueElectors could save the world . 
Calling all Electors . Vote your conscience in December . 
Only way Trump won't become a President is if some of those Republican ELECTORS break promise and turn faithless 
For Those That Don't Know How Electoral College Vote Works This May Help 
Apparently , there's a movement to influence the Electoral College on Dec 19th 
did you guys know about " faithless electors " because I definitely did not . 
Faithless electors " can legally change their mind and put someone else in office . 
Libtards are now counting on the electoral college to change their mind . Sorry this isn't going to happen . 
On Election Day, were electing the electors who elect the president. And it takes 270 of the 538 electors to win. Got it?
Lewandowski is just one of the many ways @CNN helped get Trump elected . I use to be a loyal viewer .

Backlash after Donald Trump ditches his press pool 
When president-elect Donald Trump went to dinner on Tuesday night , no one told the press . Here's why this matters . 
President-elect ditches press pool again , spurring sharp criticism 
Perhaps if he was not being " protested " by children throwing tantrums he might let them know where he is . 
The press pool exists because Americans have a right to know about POTUS whereabouts . 
Funny you didn't mention context last night . And again , never mentioned Obama once 
Aw , the poor babies at @CNN . Someone give them a banky and a pacifier . 
For those who diminish the importance of having a press pool , think about 9/11 .

Many European countries use a ranked vote system . Would solve popular vote and third party " damage " . Time for change 
With this system Electoral College might still make sense . 
It's time to end the 2-party system ! America must follow Maine's lead ! 
Good reform idea w/ bipartisan support . just passed ranked-choice voting . 
How'd electoral politics be different if third parties stood a chance ? Maine passed a law that makes it possible

Why can't Army band play ' Jingle Bells ' at Christmas show ? 
Army Band silenced from playing ' Jingle Bells 
Army says band cant perform in " religious " Christmas show| @toddstarnes 
Army band can't play ' Jingle Bells ' at Christmas show ? Jesus is THE Reason for the Season 
Army can't celebrate Jesus's birthday because Obama says it's has religious ties ! 
We weren't prohibited from playing Christmas music when I was in the Marine band . the #Grinch's changed that . 
Patton's former United States Army brought to its knees by candy canes and Christmas trees . 
The fact that soldiers cannot play Jingle Bells on a banjo inside a church is absurd. But the fact that soldiers are denied religious liberty is downright offensive.

Pundits are quick to say that it couldnt be about prejudice in states like Iowa, where Obama voters went for Trump. But racial anxiety is always close to the surface  and can easily be stoked.

Trump Victory Alarms Gay and Transgender Groups 
Trump win seen as a devastating loss for gay and transgender people 
I guess @SquirrelQueen and I are screwed . 
Pence is deplorable . His positions and the GOP platform are what worry the community . 
u are now my president , but u will never represent my values 
The GOP platform is hostile to LGBT , but will Trump give two hoots about it ? And will Pence have any influence ? 
We cannot allow rights to be stripped from us . 
The problem is Pence Victory Alarms #Gay and Transgender Groups . 
Evil comes in twos . Just as terrified of Mike Pence as Donald Trump 
The president-elect has shown no history of personal animus toward gay people, but the Republican platform and his running mate both oppose gay rights.

This from my colleague @DLeonhardt suggests near-total vindication for everything @SeanTrende wrote after 2012 
For every voter who voted Obama in 12 & amp ; Trump in 16 , at least 5 voted for Trump after not voting 4 years ago ht 
That pattern , obviously , cannot be explained by vote-switching among the white working class . 
YouGov-based analysis of US election it was the turnout gap , just not the one we were expecting 
Seems that in five key states that switched to Trump , Rep turnout rose while Dems ' fell . 
For every 1 voter who switched from Obama to Trump , at least 5 voted for Trump after not having voted 4 years ago 
so the supposed Obama-to-Trump flips were pretty minor compared to a 2016 surge in white 2012 non-voters . 
Trump has won the non-voters more than he convinced former Democrats 
Turnout did not plummet this year, as some argued. But it did change.

Audit it first then do not fumigate it . simply ABOLISH it !

The Chopped Cheeses Sharp Rise to Fame

Like any New York success story , the chopped cheese's rise to fame has come with some controversy 
A sandwich with a base of grilled ground beef, long popular in New York bodegas, is now spreading to more upscale purveyors and has prompted vigorous debate on the internet over cultural appropriation and related issues.
The Election That Almost Ate Our Souls

A Very Good excerpt from @Mobute's Very Good election profile 
congrats @Mobute for writing the best paragraph about why this election fucking sucks 
Well , this pretty much sums it up 
Congratulations @Mobute for becoming the first internet person to use " Breitbart Bangbus 
you can still read his summation of the whole damned thing 
If people sow the earth with that much hatred , eventually it bears twisted fruit . Great piece from @Mobute 
primal scream about this horrible election year is both cathartic and harrowing . 
People hated the 2012 presidential election, too. They publicly prayed for its end. It was irritating and stupid; the discourse was cheap and disappointing. Like every other election of our lifetimes, it was, all agreed, the most important, yet somehow comprised a handful of seemingly randomly-chosen and insipid points of contention.

plans 2 appeal 2 Congress 4 criminal justice reform , expanding voting rights & amp ; much more 
nation wide protests ! liberals take 2 the streets 2 exercise their principle of indiv rights . Rand would approve . 
Proud to see millions of Americans defending democracy . 
Beyond the commotion in the streets, liberal activists are preparing legislative challenges and getting ready to support social services they assume will be gutted.
Those clamoring for Facebook to fix its fake news problem should be careful what they wish for . 
Yup , the things we read have " no impact " on what we think . 
Because Zuckerberg believes the fake news his platform elevates played no part in the election

Zuckerberg may be brilliant re . technology but he is rarely intelligent in understanding human behaviour .

Donald Trumps Far-Flung Holdings Raise Potential for Conflicts of Interest 
Unless deals with this properly there will just be a steady trickle of these conflict-of-interest stories . 
As president , the American public expects that @realDonaldTrump will be held to a higher standard . 
No president in modern times will have as many potential business conflicts of interest as Trump

Is the 24-hr feed of protests on the news cycle , and the incessant commentary distracting you from other things ?

It was essential to elect Trump to prevent the corrupt , unethical Clinton from getting in . 
The conflicts are in many ways as complex as his business empire, adding a heightened degree of difficulty for Mr. Trump to separate his official duties from his private business affairs.

Autocracy: Rules for Survival
However well-intentioned, talk presuming Trump'#039;s good faith assumes that he is prepared to find common ground with his many opponents, respect the institutions of government, and repudiate almost everything he has stood for during the campaign. In short, it is treating him as a normal politician. There has until now been little evidence that he can be one. It might be worth considering the rules I've learned for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and self-respect.

One thing I agree with #Trump on , much to my dismay . But it won't happen . Too many pigs at the trough .

Women still have a lot to worry about from Trump . While he softened on healthcare , he won't be softening on abortion 
You have to be obtuse not to see that his position on those two issues honors the sanctity of life . 
Same day Trump appoints racist anti-semite to key WH job , NYT says " he appeared to inch toward the political center 
repeated his promise to name a SC justice who opposed abortion rights & amp ; would help overturn Roe v Wade

The president-elect said his immigration priority was to deport up to three million undocumented immigrants rather than 11 million and that his border wall might be a fence in places.

Know this if nothing else Richard Rorty is always , always , always correct . 
Looking for a ' strongman ' to provide the answers Richard Rorty predicted election of Trump-like figure in 1998 . 
Philosopher who predicted Trump in 1998 also predicted his 1st act as president-elect 
A philosopher anticipated the rise of Trump in 1998 
After my imagined strongman takes charge , he will quickly make his peace with the int'l superrich 
At that point , something will crack 
Doesn't surprise me at all . Rorty changed my entire view on almost everything . 
Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion . 
Age is but a number . It's the Q factor .

Big ideas as likely in your 20s as your 50s . A result much liked by this 51 year old professor

Apparently my dream of making the kiwi bobsled team need not be over . When it comes to success , its never . 
To be a successful researcher age doesnt matter ! It is the Q factor making the most of the work at hand . 
A new study points to a combination of personality, persistence and luck as leading to success, and scientists say that those same forces are at play at all levels of a discipline.

Keep in mind , President-Elect Trump never felt the need to apologize to McCain , Judge Curiel , Khan family , Megyn Kelly & amp ; Serg 
I agree Mr. President and we have had enough of the entertainment industry agenda ! We love Pence , wonderful man !

Its the job of Democratic leaders to now keep these voters engaged . Democrats cant wait until next election seaso 
The Real Lesson here Do Not be bound by The Truth . No One cares about it . Sensationalism Rules & amp ; the rest follows . 
For more than a year , Americans were glued to their smartphones as Donald J . Trump tweeted and retweeted . 
News organizations played right into Mr. Trumps hands . 
Democrats need to borrow his tactics.

never met an abortion they didn't support until now 
trolling for Trump dirt . shouldn't you have done this BEFORE the election HAHAHAHA 
Slate is the new National Inquirer . 
No shade , but it's time we start asking some . 
Media still trying to malign and defame President Elect Trump . 
They hate him , and yet they are already campaigning for him to win again in 2020 ! 
So @LV_Anderson at @slate is taking the fight to Trump and it is awesome . 
I have been saying this for MONTHS @LV_Anderson . I would bet many human earth that Trump has paid for MANY . 
The sourcing on this seems bizarrely light

Unless Mr. Trump divests his businesses, there will be no way to know if his actions in office are for the public good or for his own financial gain.
Trump assumes office at the peak of its imperial powers and unhindered by the drag of divided government .

Oh goody , Slate reposting Jamelle's article where he doubles down on the bass-ackwards that lost Dems the election . 
For Dems , the risk of working with Trump on anything constructive is legitimizing white nationalism as an appeal . 
Why does he have such a boner to attack the economic left ? 
Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , the Democrats Are Screwing Up the Resistance to Donald Trump 
Many are criticizing dems for buying into economic narrative too easily 
To The Left Some on the far left are already attacking Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for indicating he . 
This is excellent , echoes lots of important ideas that @stephenkb has been highlighting all week .

Attempts to reframe rise of Trump as anything OTHER than racist base appeal is delusional & amp ; wrong . 
Democrats are still managing their response to the next four years of a President Donald Trump. Will they work with his administration? On that score,  ...

Maine voters enacted ranked-choice voting last week ! Cuts odds of non-majority win , improves 3rd-party odds . 
It makes SO much more sense . Maine also just passed ranked-choice voting 
Maine voted to for a #RankedChoiceVoting system becoming the first state to do so . 
If the @GOP used ranked choice voting , Donald Trump would not likely have won the nomination . 
Australia , Ireland rank 3rd party votes Maine voted for a better way to vote . 
Many European countries use a ranked vote system . Would solve popular vote and third party " damage " . Time for change 
With this system Electoral College might still make sense .
