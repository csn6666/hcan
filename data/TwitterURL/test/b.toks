How an Unverified Dossier Became a Crisis for @realDonaldTrump 
Outstanding piece puts Russian rumors re Trump into context . Read this @ScottShaneNYT @nickconfessore @AllMattNYT 
The intelligence credentials of the man behind the Trump dossier & gt 
Not quite as ridiculous as #realDonaldTrump says . But then again he lies all the time . 
A wealthy anti-Trump Republican donor . A former British spy . The tale behind an unverified but explosive dossier htt 
The consequences of the dossier, put together by a former British spy named Christopher Steele, are incalculable and will play out long past Inauguration Day.
From one Senator to the next . 
With Harry Reed gone I thought the Senate would change . What a cowardly display .

exploited the gap expertly , turning one journalist against another , see this excellent column 
How Trump is manipulating the media . 
After the Liar King's birth cert . Con job , his crowd isn't allowed to use the word responsibility ; Tune them out . 
News orgs that turn on each other or fail to stick up for one another presents a big problem in the US right now . 
Trump exploited weaknesses not just the tendency of the press to eat itself , but also its own status anxieties . 
He exploited voters status anxieties in the election . Now hes doing it to journalists . 
Trump is manipulating the media the same way he did the electorate . 
He exploited traditional media outlets intense desire to be perceived as sober and objective a business . 
Media must resist the urge to turn against one another . You're dealing with a master manipulator . 
The &ldquo;liberal media&rdquo; have long been one of President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s favorite punching bags. So it was no surprise on Wednesday to hear Trump use h ...

So Federal Judge is basically disincentivizing prosecutors to go after cops . 
Because coming after the people who record your abuse & amp ; murder on their cell phones & amp ; throwing them in jail isn't near 
they're trying to criminalize and intimidate anybody ever willing to go after crooked cops in the future . 
So it's not enough that you're abusing & amp ; murdering Black people , but now you want to try & amp ; sue the people who hold you 
This is horrifying . This begins to establish a terrible precedent . Crooked cops will be entire immune to justice . 
Ladies & amp ; gentlemen . please pay attention . 
If federal judges allow law enforcement to sue DAs who charge them , they will never be prosecuted . We are living in a shit s

Do you have any examples of this ? The only time I have seen Obama shush anyone it was so he could hear a protestor . 
LOL Oh , Neil . You're So Fucking Delusional . You're Referring To Fox With Words That Describe How Fox Treated Obama 
What a joke . No , not all real news sides with your lame actions at Trump's press conference . 
Obama scoffed at Fox for telling uncomfortable truths he didn't like . CNN outright lied to purposefully harm Trump . 
Good for you , Neil ! What goes around comes around . Obama has been a total ass in too many ways for too many days !

It takes an average of 12 years to recoup the cost of getting a BA degree , according to a new College Board report . 
If you're debating the value of your college degree , rest assured it will likely be worth the cost 
I'm 41 and my degree has yet to pay off . But I still have hope . 
I really love statistics , though . Delightful way to ruin stupid people's lives . 
this article paints it acceptable to pay off student loan in 10 years is ok .

Yes, college is still worth the cost. Those with Bachelor degrees earn more over their lifetime than high school graduates.

Educating people about sources wont stop fake news . 
The only answer is to stop using Facebook for news 
People remember things that are repeated even if repetition is to ID them as false . Better to state positive 
Warning people about fake news dissuade people from getting news from FB 
Why flagging fake news might not work 
Flagging fake news sources doesn't take account for how people scan-read and half-remember 
Flagging #fakenews or bad sources doesnt account for how the brain processes information

The people and the media must hold the president to his word ! 
Mr. Trump provided no details about how his plan would work or what it would cost . 
The president-elect said he was nearly ready to unveil his proposal, though he offered no details about how it would work or how much it would cost.
Just so we understand the MOTIVATION behind the ACA repeal . 
Obamacare Repeal Will Hand a Nauseating Tax Cut to the Rich 
This is simply disgraceful . The 400 richest Americans will get tax cuts equal to Obamacare subsidies in 20 states . 
No replacement is probably what happens .

How to read Trump's tweeting Twitter and the Art of His Deal 
Trump , Twitter and the Art of His Deal 
Its like a video game for professional validation . 
Part of the peculiarity of Mr. Trumps tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity , not a politician 
There may be a little irony in my impulse to tweet this , but I'll live with it 
The irony , I am tweeting about Twitter 
Theories of a Trump Twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of his for years . 
Mr. Trump may not follow a deliberate distraction strategy , but he doesnt need one . He distracts instinctively . 
President-elect Donald J. Trump has always been hooked on recognition. More than ever, tweeting has given him a fitting outlet.

Can't say enough good things about this piece by @jbouie . One of the most insightful analyses I've read on Obama .

The optimism that helped Obama get elected doesnt work in the America that gave us President Trump , @jbouie writes .

A lot of folks did not think Obama was so hot on press freedoms to be clear 
Reminder that Obama has a pretty bad record on press freedom 
The reporters who cover national security don't love it . 
Obama has laid all the groundwork Trump needs for a crackdown on reporters.
Amazing amount of money donated to NI over the years by @atlantic as Charles F Feeney gives away last of his fortune 
James Bond of #Philanthropy Gives Away the Last of His Fortune 
No other American philanthropist has given this proportion of his/her fortune . James Bond of Philanthropy

Rex #Tillersons #SouthChinaSea Remarks Foreshadow Possible Foreign Policy Crisis 
Tillerson's dolt-CEO act is actually a serious problem . If you want a needless war with China , he's your man . 
China's contention that US blockage of China's access to its SCS artificial island wouldn't be ' legal 
Tillerson's hawkish statement on S China Sea possibly linked to Exon's close links with Vietnam 
Rex Tillerson speaks of taking a more aggressive & amp ; interventionist stance against China in the SCS 
These hearings continue to produce news Tillersons South China Sea Remarks Foreshadow Pssible Foreign Policy Crisis 
Beyond Trump's kompromat . this seems pretty important . Rex Tillersons South China Sea Remarks 
During his tenure , the company forged close ties to the Vietnamese #government signing an agreement in 2009 with . 
drew a hard line on oil-rich South China Sea not so on China's human rights violations http 
In nomination hearings, Mr. Tillerson called for China to be denied access to its artificial islands, which would be a remarkable change in the U.S. approach to the disputed waters.
China will invest $360bn in renewables by 2020 but much capacity goes unused as local officials do favours for coal 
It can power a small nation . But this massive wind farm in #China is mostly idle . 
Coal insanity is not limited to democracies . Can Power a Small Nation . But This Wind Farm in China Is Mostly Idle . 
So many great reporter words in this @nytimes piece on wind power in China . 
Theres not much we can do right now . Only the state can intervene . 
privileges #coal in market or grid access but could correct over night to protect health & amp 
Is this how alt-energy will save us from fossil fuel dependency ? 
In China wind turbines abound , but buyers of energy are scarce . Coal industry remains king . 
China builds one wind turbine every hour . But many go unused , hurt by low demand & amp ; coal-friendly policies 
The Jiuquan Wind Power Base epitomizes the countrys ambition to become a global leader in clean energy. It also reflects the deep challenges facing the sector in China.

Bye & amp ; good riddance Mr " If you like your plan . Obama " fine with changing ' ObamaCare ' to ' TrumpCare 
Calling it TrumpCare fine ; health law will survive GOP assault . 
Since the legislation was " The Affordable Care Act " fm the outset , this seems a bit overcome by events . 
Can Obama look anymore pathetic ? He wants a legacy , even if it's only in minds simple enough to believe his ego . 
Obama says health law will survive GOP assault , he's fine with calling it ' TrumpCare 
I'm sure he'd love to hang this anchor around Trump's neck . Along with Iran , Syria , Afghanistan , Russia , etc . 
Obama- he's fine with changing ' ObamaCare ' to ' TrumpCare Y Can't we just call it " ALL CARE " or " AMERI-CARE 
This poor excuse of a man will always put ego above truth & amp ; never care about America more than himself & amp ; Islam . 
I'm sure he would be fine with that ! But no , it will always be known as failed Obamacare ! 
President Obama said Sunday that hes OK with Republicans making changes to his Affordable Care Act and even changing its name from ObamaCare to TrumpCare.

Cohen accepts no responsibility for the ugly discourse & amp ; lack of civility his " Housewives " shows have spawned 
Nodding along with this piece that connects the popularity of the Housewives with the election of That Orange Guy . 
Flipping a table and building your brand Living in Andy Cohens America 
Had he seen the polls ? Trumps not going to win , I told him . Cohen pursed his lips . You never know .

Cohen knows that people interacting will always create something interesting . 
Please read this profile of @Andy and the incredible empire he's built . 
If you're surprised at the turn this country has taken , you haven't been listening to Andy Cohen very closely 
No one understands our new era of reality-TV populism better than the man who turned The Real Housewives into an empire.

Fascinating NYT piece the women who voted for Trump , and why they did , in Their Own Words 
Deeply frustrating read . But nothing sadder than woman who compares Trump to her ex , thinks she could change him . 
The one who voted for Trump because Hillary has ethics issues . 
The one who voted for Trump because Obama was president to be a celebrity . 
The one who voted for Trump because she understands the fears of the lgbtq community . 
The one who voted for Trump because she believes in gay marriage . 
The one who voted for Trump because she doesn't want the feminist movement to go backwards . 
I honestly have no idea what to say to the women in this article . 
Even when offended, some looked past Donald J. Trumps flaws to issues like jobs and immigration. Distrust of Hillary Clinton and a liking for Ivanka Trump also helped.
